# Notes on analysis

The analysis takes the form of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and is split into a number of analyses which are designed to be run in a particular order, usually indicated by the two digits at the start of their filename.

## Structure

The directory structure is

```
.
├── data
├── indata
├── output
└── R
    └── utils
```

NB the folder data/ is excluded from the repo - it must be created by hand in the right relative location for scripts to write large temporary data to. All necessary input data to run the analysis is in indata/.


## Dependencies

This analysis was run using R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18).

The following R packages must be available:

- utility: here, glue
- data manipulation: data.table, dplyr,
- plotting: ggplot2, ggthemes, scales, ggrepel, ggpubr
- calculations: discly, HEdtree (via devtools::install_github('petedodd/packagename'))
- spatial strucutre (optional, since output also included): tmap, rworldmap, spdep


The estimates of household size by index TB age/sex is based on previously published work:

- https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30401-7/fulltext
- https://github.com/petedodd/PINT


## Memory requirements

With a full-size PSA, a reasonable amount of RAM is needed (it was run on a machine with 36Gb).

Commenting out the rep limitation in file 04 around line 14 (ie using 100 replicates) should allow use on a machine with (eg) 8Gb RAM.


## TODO other changes

- need to include the costs

### 00.FQRinRR.R ###

This file generates the estimates of FQR resistance in RR. It is optional to run this analysis as the output is included in indata/. Within this analysis, there are two parts: part 1 generates the nearest neighbour structure and is also optional (output in indata/); part 2 uses the neighbour structure to generate the FQR estimates. 

### 01.HHcontactNumbers.R ###

This file uses notification data and previous estimates of household contacts to construct numbers at risk as the starting point for the PSA object.

### 02.RRnumCDR.R ###

This file calculatates the RR case detection ratios as RRest.csv for later use, but is otherwise self-contained.

### 03.DResistance.R ###

This file builds the base PSA object for onward analyses.


### 04.calculations.R ###

This file performs the calculations. 

TODO
- remove 100 rep limitation (late adjustment, not on laptop)

It loads:

utils/
- maketree.R (builds decision tree)
- ModelFuns.R (functions for constructing necessary variables)


#### ModelFuns.R ####

TODO
- check HIV-specific IRR for PT used
- WBL for LTBI?

### 05.outputs.R ###

Calls:

utils/
- makeLYs.R

which will be a bit slow first time around

TODO
- see the few flagged checks in script


## Other processing TODOs ##

- hhc unc?
- hivp; hivi
- HIC or not
